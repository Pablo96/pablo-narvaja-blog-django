# pablo-narvaja-blog-django
The backend of my blog rewritten in Django as a learning exercise.  
It follows a REST API design.  

## Project Goal
To learn the basics of rest api implementation with django/drf  

## Dependencies
- django-debug-toolbar
- django-rest-framework

## Project Scope
- ABM for tags, blogs, page configuration (about sections, footer)
- Require log-in (Oauth2) for every endpoint except log-in and sign-up
- ABM of users and superusers
- Not a production ready product so logging and production/debug settings are not a priority and may never be implemented
